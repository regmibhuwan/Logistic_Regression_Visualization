# Logistic Regression Visualization

This repository contains a detailed implementation of logistic regression on different datasets, showcasing how logistic regression works, decision boundary visualization, and the effects of regularization.

## Contents

- `C1_W3_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of logistic regression, visualization of decision boundaries, and the impact of different regularization parameters.
- Figures demonstrating the decision boundaries:
  - `figure 1.png`: Scatter plot of training data.
  - `figure 2.png`: Training data with decision boundary.
  - `figure 3.png`: Plot of training data for microchip tests.
  - `figure 4.png`: Training data with decision boundary (λ = 1).
  - `figure 5.png`: No regularization (overfitting) with decision boundary (λ = 0).
  - `figure 6.png`: Too much regularization (underfitting) with decision boundary (λ = 100).
- `public_tests.py`: Public test cases for validating the implementation.
- `test_utils.py`: Utility functions for testing.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for logistic regression implementation.
